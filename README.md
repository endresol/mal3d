# Moon Ape Lab 3D

This project contains the code for the Moon Ape Lab 3D collection contract and minting dapp.

The project is cloned from the HashlipsLabs repo with some additional input from datboi-1337

## Solidity smart contract

The smart contract for this collections is a bot more complex that your standard NFT collection
The collections has a 2d conterpart and the two collections need to be linked in a way. We will achive this by adding metadata to the collection.

### Minting rules

Also the minting rules are a bit different.

The team will be able to mint their current 2d versions for free.
Then raffle winner etc can mint up to 3 of their current 2d version for free.

This is followed by 2 whitelists rounds for different fees.

Then a mint for partner project holders

And at last a public mint.

For the first 4 phases the reveal should be instant, but for the last two on a set date, and if not sold-out, the remaining should be hidden.
